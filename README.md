# POCALI: Prediction and insight On CAncer LncRNA by Integrating multi-omics data with machine learning

POCALI is a novel interpretable machine-learning method that integrated multiple mechanisms and features from six perspectives (epigenomics, genomics, transcriptomics, phenotype, network, and mutation)  to predict and provide functional insight into cancer lncRNAs.

## Pre-requisite
```
conda env create -f env.yaml
```

## Introduction
lncRNAs are receiving increasing attention as cancer markers for cancer diagnosis and treatment, yet identifying cancer lncRNAs has been challenging due to insufficient wet experimental validation and the complexity of the underlying mechanism. Our research introduces POCALI, a novel machine-learning method that leverages 44 multi-omics features in six categories to predict and provide functional insight into cancer lncRNAs. This method represents a significant advance in cancer lncRNA prediction and understanding their potential roles in cancer. You can explore the potential mechanism for each POCALI-predicted CalncRNAs through this [panel app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/rzy99/POCALI_feature_analysis).
